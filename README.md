What it does
This is a simple demo that is built using Next.js, Crossmint and Aptos. A user can open the demo URL linked in the repo, and provide a metadata and directly mint an NFT on Aptos for free.





The problem it solves
Right now, there seems to be no simple (and free) UI where a user can go and mint an NFT on Aptos. This solves that issue. Another problem is that there is a steep learning curve to create and deploy an NFT contract on Aptos, using my repo, an NFT can be created and minted on Aptos without the need to write a smart contract on Move.



Challenges I ran into
I had a few issues fixing a couple of edge cases and configuring API calls. 



Technologies I used
